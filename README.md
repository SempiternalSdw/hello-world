# hello-world
I don't know yet what a repository actually is but i just started my programming course and it says i need this GitHub account, so here it is. 
So i have to write abuout myself. Well i like to consider myself an independent woman, i am totally in love with my freedom, i like adventures, i love taking risks, i like to try new things. I am like a book. You can get to know me if you really invest time and concentration in reading me.
